# Frontend

[https://github.com/open-fractal/flur](https://github.com/open-fractal/flur)

The frontend is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that provides the user interface for interacting directly with CAT Protocol contracts using unisat. 


## Getting Started

You can clone the repo and run it locally to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-fractal/flur.git
cd flur
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Configuration

Once the frontend is running locally, you may decide that you want to connect to a local instance of the Tracker API instead of the public one. To do this, you can set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable to the URL of your local Tracker API instance. Follow the [backend guide](/docs/open-source/backend) first to get the Tracker API running locally.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```bash:.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

In this example, ensure the Tracker API is running locally at `http://localhost:3001`.
